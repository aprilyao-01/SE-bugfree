## Why choose this User Stories?
A user story is a simple description of requirements, a popular agile method for capturing user requirements.It provide the expected context and clarity. In the Requirements Brief, there are many different kinds of customers and requirements so that we think a user stroy is a good way to describe it.
## Explaination of User Stories
User stories follow the format "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire>, so that <outcome>". So we need to figure out who the customer is, who the role is in the system, what do they want the system to do and what their purpose is. According to textual analysis, We can know there are  types of roles : *a family member with several accounts*, *saver*, *client*, *customers*, *multi-account customers*,*joint accounts* (including some specific customers). "I want" is followed by the functionality of the system. So we search out their requirements for the system and finished writing the "want" section. For example, as a *saver*, "know how much I spent on different categories and know how much goes to fun and know how much left each month for fun and causal spending" is what he want system to do. Finally, we find out the reason they want these features and write it. For example, as a *saver*, "I can maximize how much I can move into savings at the end of a month" is why he want system to do that.

## User Stories
As *a family member with several accounts*, I want to know how much I spent on different categories and know how much goes to fun and know how much left each month for fun and causal spending so that I use spreadsheets to manage my tight budgets and I do not accidentally spend money needed for bills.

As a *saver* I want to know how much I spent on different categories and know how much goes to fun and know how much left each month for fun and causal spending so that I can maximize how much I can move into savings at the end of a month.

As a *client who is worried about budgets*, I want to see what is spent, how much is still going to come out of the account before pay day and what is free to use, so that I use spreadsheets to manage my tight budgets. 

As a *client*, I want to create a standard amount that is ‘set aside’ for e.g., food or gifts or for going out, or for saving so that it can help me calculate an available spare budget.

As a *customer*, I want to set an ‘average’ or ‘usual cost’ for the monthly variable payments that is the same every month and update the spreadsheet with an exact amount, so that I use spreadsheet to see a total of how much is exactly fixed every month for bills and see which categories are schedules to go out but are variable (e.g., phone bill). 

As a *customer*, I want to copy every expenditure into a separate sheet, give it a date and categorize it and I want to categorize a shop the first time when it comes up and change the default categories for a transaction from a recognized shop at any time so that I can see a total for the money spent on different categories and types. 

As a *multi-account-user*, I want to see the information the same as the single-account user and both see the summary calculated across all accounts and the summary for each individual account and want to check whether there is enough money left in one specific account so that I can manage my accounts better.

As a *Joint-account user*, I want to see who has spent money and need to find out more so that I can manage my accounts better.
