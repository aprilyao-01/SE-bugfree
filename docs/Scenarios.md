## Introduction
We have three scnarios to express three different situations.
*Scenario1:* Multi-account-users view the summary
*Scenario2:* Use the app to record the fixed and additional income
*Scenario3:* Use the app to record the fixed and variable spending

## Why choose scenarios
- Scenarios can more focuse on the user in a particular request for all the actions and software interface interpretation

- The material provides a lot of different situations, and it is possible to use scnarios to analyze each situation more quickly and compare several cases to figure out what is the same (can be used as a general method) and what is special (can be used as a special method)

- Scnarios can be used to more detailed analysis of what functions need to be used in the construction of software, and more efficient communication in the subsequent coding
